# Describe a creature

Develop a set of rules for simulating the real-world behavior of a creature, such as a nervous fly, swimming fish, hopping bunny, slithering snake, etc. Can you control the objectâ€™s motion by only manipulating the acceleration? Try to give the creature a personality through its behavior (rather than through its visual design).



## small fish

There could be many, similar small fish. They would swarm - usually behaving like a single unit (a school). The school would move with purpous: straight lines, banking slowly or occasional sharp turns followed by more straight swimming. Movement could be towards a thing (food, shelter), towards nothing (exploring), or away from a danger (bigger fish, sea mammal).

Individual fish could follow the movement of the school, with an offset. The offset could move a little bit around its own centre, hinting at a jiggle or wave proprelling the fish along.



## large fish, sea mammal

When not hungry, a larger sea predator would move slowly and steadily. They would occasionally turn so as to explore territory. Their overall movment would follow these rules, but might include the same kind of wobble (or tail flicking) as they use their body as a propulsion system.

When discovering food, they would circle around the fish, or school, waiting for the right moment to strike. They might push through the school to break it up. Having selected a prey, they would accelarate hard towards it, capturing their prey and then moving off through the school, possibly at a slower rate now they've fed.
