# The Nature Of Code - examples & exercises

Daniel Shiffman's The Nature Of Code walks its readers through foundations in creating simulations of real-world
phenomena in a computer. It teaches maths and programming techniques including object-oriented programming
targeting the Processing language/environment.

This repository gathers my implementations of the examples and exercises, as well as diversions I create for
myself. My thoughts on these can be found at [my blog](http://simon.theotherdell.com). 

I chose to follow the tutorials in Processing and then to reimplement most of them and some of the asides in
JavaScript, targeting the HTML5 Canvas. I want to learn about the Canvas and, as HTML and JavaScript are the core
technologies in my "day job", I wanted to show (to myself and potentially to clients) how I could use the animation and
simulation ideas in practical ways.
